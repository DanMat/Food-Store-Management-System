The following General Terms and Conditions apply to all sales made by Dragonix Foodmart, hereinafter referred to as “Seller,” and no modifications thereto shall be of any force unless confirmed in writing by Seller. Where the terms hereof vary with any document provided by the Purchaser, the terms set forth herein shall be effective and controlling.

CONTRACT, ORDER ACCEPTANCE: All orders are subject to acceptance by Seller. Any such order shall be in the accordance with these General Terms and Condition. If the Seller starts to perform on an order or contract, this will imply the acceptance of the order or contract by the Purchaser and these General Terms and Conditions shall apply. Also, non-signature of an order or contract by Purchaser does not render null and void the terms of the order or contract. All contracts have end dates which the seller is not obligated to extend beyond that date. However, if the seller agrees to extension beyond the original end date, any and all carry charges or related expenses associated with the extension will be the responsibility of the purchaser.
